# Knowledge

This directory holds company-wide reference documents available to all Evermore employees.

Content will be added as departments onboard to the Claude platform. Documents placed here carry a `public` data classification and are visible to everyone in the organization.

## What belongs here

- Company-wide policies and procedures
- Organizational structure and team overviews
- Shared playbooks and how-to guides
- Product and business context relevant to all employees
- Cross-department reference material

## What does NOT belong here

- Department-internal workflows or runbooks (use `dept-{name}-context/`)
- IT/Security-restricted content like risk registers or people profiles (use `it-ops-context/`)
- Anything with a data classification above `public`
